Biological systems are constantly changing, and their networks of interactions evolve over time. One example is the cell cycle, where proteins interact in specific ways at different stages.

My work looks at how these temporal interaction networks can be used to infer the phases of the cell cycle. By studying the timing and structure of proteinâ€“protein interactions, I aim to uncover how dynamic networks reflect underlying biological processes.
