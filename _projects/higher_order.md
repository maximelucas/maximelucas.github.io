Many systems cannot be fully described just by looking at pairwise connections: they often involve groups of units interacting together. This is what we call higher-order interactions, and they provide a richer picture of how complex systems work.

My research explores these group interactions in real data and models, to see how they shape the structure and behavior of networks. By moving beyond simple links, I aim to understand patterns and dynamics that only emerge when many elements interact at once.
