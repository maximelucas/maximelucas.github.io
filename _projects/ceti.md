Project CETI (**Ce**tacean **T**ranslation **I**nitiative) aims at deciphering the communication of one of the worldâ€™s most enigmatic ocean species: the sperm whale.

With Project CETI, we study how sperm whales use vocalizations to communicate and how these sounds relate to their social and biological lives. Vocal style can carry information about identity, relationships, or context, offering a window into the complexity of whale communication.
