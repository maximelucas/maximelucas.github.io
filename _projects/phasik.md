Phasik is a python package that was created to infer temporal phases in temporal networks. 
It contains various utility classes and functions that can be divided into two main parts:
1. Build, analyse, and visualise temporal networks from time series data.
2. Infer temporal phases by clustering the snapshots of the temporal network.
