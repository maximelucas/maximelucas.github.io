*Synchronisation* is a well-known phenomenon that plays a key role in physics, biology, and neuroscience, to cite a few. A typical example is when people in an audience clap in unison, because of their (audio and visual) *interactions*, or when heart cells synchronise to make the heart beat. A lot of theoretical work exists on synchronisation, but mostly considers pairwise interactions. 

Evidence suggests, though, that *higher-order* interactions, i.e. between more than two units a time, are important to fully capture complex processes. To study this, we consider generalisations of the Kuramoto mode, where we include interactions terms between two or more oscilators.
