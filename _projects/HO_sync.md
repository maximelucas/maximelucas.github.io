*Synchronisation* is a well-known phenomenon that plays a key role in physics, biology, and neuroscience, to cite a few. Typical examples are when people clap in unison at the end of a concert, or when heart cells synchronise to make the heart beat. My research on synchronisation focuses on the effects of two ingredients: (1) higher-order interactions, that is when oscillators interact in groups, and (2) time-varying parameters, 

### Synchronisation with higher-order interactions

Evidence suggests, though, that *higher-order* interactions are important to fully capture complex processes. To study this, we consider generalisations of the Kuramoto model, where we include interactions terms between two or more oscilators. See my othr work on higher-order networks [here]({% link _projects/higher_order.md %}).

### Synchronisation with time-varying parameters

A lot of theoretical work exists on synchronisation, but mostly considers the frequencies and interaction network to be constant. In nature, and in living systems in particular, however, *frequencies change all the time*. Imagine how our heartbeat changes when we are calm, stressed, or scared. This is what motivates our studies on *synchronisation* between oscillators *with time-varying parameters*. In particular, in different studies, we consider time-varying frequencies, coupling strengths, and network structure.
