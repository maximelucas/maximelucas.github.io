Branching networks are everywhere in nature â€” from fungal mycelium to blood vessels. Understanding how they form and function helps us grasp the universal principles behind growth, transport, and resilience in complex systems.

Studying fungi in particular is especially relevant, as their networks play a vital role in ecosystems: they recycle nutrients, exchange resources with plants, and shape the structure of soils. My work explores how branching networks emerge and function, using fungi as a natural example. By looking at how these networks expand, branch, and merge, I aim to uncover general insights into the dynamics of biological and spatial networks.
