  abstract={A key challenge of nonlinear dynamics and network science is to understand how higher-order interactions influence collective dynamics. Although many studies have approached this question through linear stability analysis, less is known about how higher-order interactions shape the global organization of different states. Here, we shed light on this issue by analyzing the rich patterns supported by identical Kuramoto oscillators on hypergraphs. We show that higher-order interactions can have opposite effects on linear stability and basin stability: they stabilize twisted states (including full synchrony) by improving their linear stability, but also make them hard to find by dramatically reducing their basin size. Our results highlight the importance of understanding higher-order interactions from both local and global perspectives.},

  abstract={Social learning is key in the development of both human and non-human animal societies. Here, we provide quantitative evidence that supports the existence of social learning in sperm whales across socio-cultural barriers, based on acoustic data from locations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Sperm whale populations have traditionally been partitioned into clans based on their vocal repertoire (what they say) of rhythmically patterned clicks (codas), and in particular their identity codas, which serve as symbolic markers for each clan. However, identity codas account for between 35% and 60% of all codas vocalized depending on the different clans. We introduce a computational modeling approach that recovers clan structure and shows new evidence of social learning across clans from the internal temporal structure of non-identity codas, the remaining fraction of codas. The proposed method is based on vocal style, which encodes how sperm whales assemble individual clicks into codas. Specifically, we modeled clicking pattern data using generative models based on variable length Markov chains, producing what we term "subcoda trees". Based on our results, we propose here a new concept of vocal identity, which consists of both vocal repertoire and style. We show that (i) style-delimited clans are similar to repertoire-delimited clans, and that (ii) sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, but has no significant effect on identity codas. This implies that different clans who geographically overlap have similar styles for most codas, which in turn implies social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, the proposed method provides a new framework for comparing communication systems of other animal species, with potential implications for our understanding of cultural transmission in animal societies.},

Our framework is based on topology, discrete differential geometry as well as gradient flows and frustrations, and permits a systematic analysis of their properties. We establish an equivalence between the simple simplicial Kuramoto model and the standard Kuramoto model on pairwise networks under the condition of manifoldness of the simplicial complex. Then, starting from simple models, we describe the notion of simplicial synchronization and derive bounds on the coupling strength necessary or sufficient for achieving it. For some variants, we generalize these results and provide new ones, such as the controllability of equilibrium solutions.

  abstract={Higher-order interactions, through which three or more entities interact simultaneously, are important to the faithful modeling of many real-world complex systems. Recent efforts have focused on elucidating the effects of these nonpairwise interactions on the collective behaviors of coupled systems. Interestingly, several examples of higher-order interactions promoting synchronization have been found, raising speculations that this might be a general phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate that even for simple systems such as Kuramoto oscillators, the effects of higher-order interactions are highly nuanced. In particular, we show numerically and analytically that hyperedges typically enhance synchronization in random hypergraphs, but have the opposite effect in simplicial complexes. As an explanation, we identify higher-order degree heterogeneity as the key structural determinant of synchronization stability in systems with a fixed coupling budget. Typical to nonlinear systems, we also capture regimes where pairwise and nonpairwise interactions synergize to optimize synchronization. Our work contributes to a better understanding of dynamical systems with structured higher-order interactions.},

  abstract={Single contagion processes are known to display a continuous transition from an epidemic-free phase at low contagion rates to the epidemic state for rates above a critical threshold. This transition can become discontinuous when two simple contagion processes are coupled in a bi-directional symmetric way. However, in many cases, the coupling is not symmetric and the processes can be of a different nature. For example, social behaviors---such as hand-washing or mask-wearing---can affect the spread of a disease, and their adoption dynamics via social reinforcement mechanisms are better described by complex contagion models, rather than by the simple contagion paradigm, which is more appropriate for disease spreading phenomena. Motivated by this example, we consider a simplicial contagion (describing the adoption of a behavior) that uni-directionally drives a simple contagion (describing a disease propagation). We show that, above a critical driving strength, such driven simple contagion can exhibit both discontinuous transitions and bi-stability, which are instead absent in standard simple contagions. We provide a mean-field analytical description of the phase diagram of the system, and complement the results with Markov-chain simulations. Our results provide a novel route for a simple contagion process to display the phenomenology of a higher-order contagion, through a driving mechanism that may be hidden or unobservable in many practical instances.},

A paradigmatic case is that of synchronization, occuring when oscillators reach coherent dynamics through their mutual couplings, and which is known to display richer collective phenomena when connections are not limited to simple dyads. Here, we consider an extension of the Kuramoto model with higher-order interactions, where oscillators can interact in groups of any size, arranged in any arbitrary complex topology. We present a new operator, the multiorder Laplacian, which allows us to treat the system analytically and that can be used to assess the stability of synchronization in general higher-order networks.

Applying this to one-dimensional phase dynamics, we provide stability definitions somewhat analogous to the classical infinite-time definitions associated with Aleksandr Lyapunov.

We show how the time-varying parameters can enlarge the range of other parameters for which synchronous behaviour is stable. In addition, it can yield additional behaviours such as intermittent synchronisation. The stability of these systems is analysed via short- and long-time Lyapunov exponents, both analytically and numerically. The different dynamical regimes are also described via time-frequency representation. Finally, we compare the stabilising effect of deterministic non-autonomous driving to that of bounded noise. All in all, we give an overview of some effects time-varying parameters can have on synchronisation.

  abstract={The emergence of synchronization in systems of coupled agents is a pivotal phenomenon in physics, biology, computer science, and neuroscience. Traditionally, interaction systems have been described as networks, where links encode information only on the pairwise influences among the nodes. Yet, in many systems, interactions among the units take place in larger groups. Recent work has shown that the presence of higher-order interactions between oscillators can significantly affect the emerging dynamics. However, these early studies have mostly considered interactions up to four oscillators at time, and analytical treatments are limited to the all-to-all setting. Here, we propose a general framework that allows us to effectively study populations of oscillators where higher-order interactions of all possible orders are considered, for any complex topology described by arbitrary hypergraphs, and for general coupling functions. To this end, we introduce a multiorder Laplacian whose spectrum determines the stability of the synchronized solution. Our framework is validated on three structures of interactions of increasing complexity. First, we study a population with all-to-all interactions at all orders, for which we can derive in a full analytical manner the Lyapunov exponents of the system, and for which we investigate the effect of including attractive and repulsive interactions. Second, we apply the multiorder Laplacian framework to synchronization on a synthetic model with heterogeneous higher-order interactions. Finally, we compare the dynamics of coupled oscillators with higher-order and pairwise couplings only, for a real dataset describing the macaque brain connectome, highlighting the importance of faithfully representing the complexity of interactions in real-world systems. Taken together, our multiorder Laplacian allows us to obtain a complete analytical characterization of the stability of synchrony in arbitrary higher-order networks, paving the way toward a general treatment of dynamical processes beyond pairwise interactions.},

Over the past decades, a variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, from human communications to chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can often occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be described simply in terms of dyads. Until recently little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can enhance our modeling capacities and help us understand and predict their dynamical behavior. Here we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We discuss how to represent higher-order interactions and introduce the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing bipartite graphs, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We introduce the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and dynamical topology, discussing the relations between higher-order interactions and collective behavior. We focus in particular on new emergent phenomena characterizing dynamical processes, such as diffusion, synchronization, spreading, social dynamics and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions.

@phdthesis{lucas2019synchronisation,
title = "Synchronisation and stability in nonautonomous oscillatory systems",
abstract = "Many natural and artificial systems can be modelled by ensembles of coupled oscillators. These types of systems can exhibit various synchronisation phenomena, where the interaction between the oscillators leads them to some kind of coherent behaviour, despite heterogeneities in the system. Moreover, many such systems are subject to a timevariable environment which effectively drives them. Many examples can be found in living systems, e.g., the dynamics of a cell is strongly dependent on the ever-changing intra- and extra-cellular ionic concentrations.Motivated by these considerations, this thesis investigates the effect of time-varying parameters on synchronisation and stability in ensembles of coupled oscillators. Timevariability is a crucial ingredient of the dynamics of many real-life systems, and interest in it is only recently starting to grow. Such systems are in general described by nonautonomous equations, which are hard to treat in general. This present work aims at answering questions such as: Can time-variability be detrimental/beneficial to synchronisation? If so, under which conditions? Can time-variability seed new dynamical phenomena? How can one best treat nonautonomous systems?The systems studied can be divided into two categories. First, the effect of a driving oscillator with a time-varying frequency is investigated. It is shown that increasing the amplitude of the frequency modulation can increase the size of the stability region in parameter space, under general assumptions. Short-term dynamics and stability properties are also investigated, and their dynamics is shown to be of importance. Second, the effect of time-varying couplings between the oscillators is considered. This is shown to be able to make the synchronous state unstable and yield oscillation death.Overall, the thesis illustrates that time-variability can be either beneficial or detrimental to synchronous dynamics, and investigates in detail and gives insight about cases of both. It argues towards the general fact that short-term dynamics is often crucial to a physically relevant understanding of nonautonomous systems.",

To test the hypothesis that deterministic nonautonomous perturbation is a good candidate for stabilizing complex dynamics, we consider a network of identical phase oscillators driven by an oscillator with a slowly time-varying frequency. We investigate both the short- and long-term stability of the synchronous solutions of this nonautonomous system. For attractive couplings we show that the region of stability grows as the amplitude of the frequency modulation is increased, through the birth of an intermittent synchronization regime. For repulsive couplings, we propose a control strategy to stabilize the dynamics by altering very slightly the network topology. We also show how, without changing the topology, time-variability in the driving frequency can itself stabilize the dynamics. As a byproduct of the analysis, we observe chimeralike states. We conclude that time-variability-induced stability phenomena are also present in networks, reinforcing the idea that this is a quite realistic scenario for living systems to use in maintaining their functioning in the face of ongoing perturbations.},

Using analytical and numerical methods that provide information on time-variable dynamical properties, we find that the growth of the Arnold tongue is specifically due to the growth of a region of intermittent synchronization where trajectories alternate between short-term stability and short-term neutral stability, giving rise to stability on average. We also present examples of higher-dimensional nonlinear oscillators where a similar stabilization phenomenon is numerically observed.
