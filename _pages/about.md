Welcome! I am a physicist working at the intersection of dynamical systems and networks, with a strong interest in applications to the life sciences. My research combines theory, data analysis, and experiments to explore the complexity of systems such as fungal networks, brains, and animal communication.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow funded by the [FNRS](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/), working on the structure and growth of fungal networks. I am based at the [Namur Institute for Complex Systems](https://www.naxys.be/) (University of Namur) and [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/eli/elim/team-mycology.html). I am also part of [Project CETI](https://www.projectceti.org/), a large interdisciplinary collaboration trying to decipher the communication of sperm whales.

Previously, I was postdoctoral researcher at the [CENTAI Institute](https://centai.eu/) and the [ISI Foundation](https://isi.it) in Turin with [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/), and before that at [CENTURI](http://centuri-livingsystems.org/) in Marseille with [Alain Barrat](http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/), [Bianca Habermann](http://www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/equipe/computational-biology/), and [Laurent Tichit](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~tichit/).
I obtained my PhD as part of the [COSMOS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/642563) Marie Curie training network co-supervised by [Aneta Stefanovska](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/aneta-stefanovska) (Lancaster University) and [Duccio Fanelli](https://sites.google.com/site/ducciofanelli1/home) (University of Florence). I also hold an MSc in Physics from Université Libre de Bruxelles and a complementary MSc in Artificial Intelligence from KU Leuven.

Feel free to reach out for questions, collaborations, or just to say hello!
