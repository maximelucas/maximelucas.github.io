Welcome to my page!   

I am a physicist with a strong interest in dynamical systems, complex systems, and networks, and their application to the life sciences.   

I am currently working on various projects including EEG data, dynamical systems on networks, and higher-order networks. I work with [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/) at the [ISI Foundation](isi.it) in Turin (Italy). 

My previous position was at the interdisciplinary Turing Centre for Living Systems ([CENTURI](http://centuri-livingsystems.org/)) in Marseille (France). As such, I was working on **temporal networks of proteins** with [Alain Barrat](http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/) (Centre de Physique Théorique), [Bianca Habermann](http://www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/equipe/computational-biology/) (Institut de Biologie du Développement de Marseille) and [Laurent Tichit](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~tichit/) (Institut de Mathématiques de Marseille).   

Before that,  during my PhD, I worked on the **synchronisation** of nonautonomous networks of oscillators. The project was part of [COSMOS](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/cosmos-itn/), a Marie Curie training network, and I was co-supervised by [Aneta Stefanoska](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/aneta-stefanovska) (Lancaster University, UK) and [Duccio Fanelli](https://sites.google.com/site/ducciofanelli1/home) (University of Florence, Italy). I also hold a Complementary Master's in Artificial Intelligence from KULeuven (Belgium) and a Master's in Physics from Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium).
