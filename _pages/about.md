Welcome to my page!   

I am a physicist with a strong interest in dynamical systems, complex systems, and networks, and their application to the life sciences.   

I am currently working on various [projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %}) including theoretical models of dynamical processes on networks (synchronisation, contagion), and the analysis of experimental data such as the brain's electrical activity or whale speech. I work with [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/) at the [CENTAI Institute](https://centai.eu/) in Turin (Italy), and previously at the [ISI Foundation](isi.it). I use a variety of approaches including for example dynamical systems theory, network science, and topological data analysis.


Before that, I worked on temporal networks of proteins with [Alain Barrat](http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/), [Bianca Habermann](http://www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/equipe/computational-biology/), and [Laurent Tichit](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~tichit/) at the interdisciplinary Turing Centre for Living Systems ([CENTURI](http://centuri-livingsystems.org/)) in Marseille (France).   

Before that, during my PhD, I worked on the synchronisation of nonautonomous networks of oscillators. The project was part of [COSMOS](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/cosmos-itn/), a Marie Curie training network, and I was co-supervised by [Aneta Stefanoska](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/aneta-stefanovska) (Lancaster University, UK) and [Duccio Fanelli](https://sites.google.com/site/ducciofanelli1/home) (University of Florence, Italy). I also hold a Complementary Master's in Artificial Intelligence from KULeuven (Belgium) and a Master's in Physics from Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium). 

Do not hesitate to contact me for questions/comments/ideas/.. or just to say hi!
